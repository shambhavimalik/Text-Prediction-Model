# Text-Prediction-Model

This model predicts upto 3 words that the user might use next based upon the text entered. It was built using text data from Twitter, Blogs and News. Currently, it's built for English Text and can be further used for other languages. It is made by building n-gram models (bigrams, trigrams and quadgrams).
